White Canvas Boilerplate
===
​
This is a boilerplate starter theme for White Canvas Wordpress projects.  It is not meant to be used as is, but as a starting point for custom themes
for each client.  There are several pre defined modules available after installation and an ACF sync.  This theme was originally based off of [underscores](https://underscores.me).
​
* Module starting point and examples - ACF fields, html template, SASS, and animations.
* Commonly needed third party scripts - [GreenSock](https://greensock.com/), [Waypoints](http://imakewebthings.com/waypoints/), [Magnific Modal](https://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/)
* Organized SASS files to quickly get started with custom designs

Getting Started
---------------
​
Download master zip file from BitBucket. Copy the theme or upload it through WP in your local environment and then rename the folder to the project name.
Then it is recommended to find/replace particular strings within the theme to make it client specific.  It is important to make sure you are matching on case.
​
1. Search for: `wcanvas-boilerplate` and replace with: `custom-theme-name`.  This should catch text domain and filter/actions
2. Search for: `wcanvas_boilerplate_` and replace with: `custom_theme_name_`.  This should catch all function declarations
3. Search for: `wcanvasBoilerplate` and replace with: `CustomThemeName`.  This should catch all class declarations.
4. Search for: `wcanvas_BOILERPLATE` and replace with: `CUSTOM_THEME_NAME`.  This should catch all constants.
5. Search for: `wcanvas Boilerplate` and replace with: `Custom Theme Name`.  This should catch all strings and titles.
6. Rename any files that have wcanvas boilerplate in the name.  Languages/wcanvas-boilerplate.pot.
​
After the optional renaming, these steps will get the theme ready for you to start developing.
​
1. Go into the theme directory and run `npm install`.
2. Startup gulp with `npm run watch` or `gulp && gulp watch`.
3. Install Advanced Custom Fields, Gravity Forms, Yoast SEO, and Classic Editor.
4. Activate your theme.
5. Go into Custom Fields and sync all fields.
